My name is **Neal Dawson-Elli** and I'm a graduate student at the University of Washington studyign Chemcial Engineering. 

My research focuses on using data science techniques to try to aid in the solving of extremely stiff physics-based lithium-ion battery models, chiefly the [P2D model](link), which will
be described in a detailed blog post in the future.  My first [paper](http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/165/2/A1.abstract?ct) has been published, which is always exciting!
I'm currently working on two more projects, which will be documented as they progress.

Most of my day-to-day activities in research include coding in Python and Julia, as well as using numerical solution techniques in Maple, Matlab, Fortran, and Julia, and creating interfaces
between these languages.  My machine learning packages include Sci-Kit Learn and Tensorflow.

## Hobbies

Whenever I'm not working, I love hiking, photography, playing soccer, lifting, running, tinkering, and prototyping.  As I get time, the projects list will be fleshed out more thoroughly.

## Previous Industry Experience

### 08/17-09/17 Software Engineer at Faraday Technologies, Dayton, OH

My responsibilities here focused on using neural networks to predict characteristics of manufacturing processes.  This involved formatting data, cleaning data, filtering out
noise, and determining the best methods for analysis and visualization.  Additionally, I created a toolbox in Python that allowed for the visualization of the data
in addition to performing the desired calculations efficiently and correctly.

### 01/14 - 06/15 Technician at OLEDWorks, Rochester, NY

My responsibilities here included the day-to-day operation and maintenance associated with running a chemical vapor deposition chamber for
the creation of ogranic LED light fixtures.  In addition to performing this function, I wrote several Excel VBA macros for both data analysis and payroll 
that are in still in use today.  The code is well documented and has been maintained by myself and others since I left.

### 03/13 - 08/13 Technician at Empire Precision plastics, Rochester, NY

In this role, my main task was to manage other workers and oversee the production of injection molded pieces, including using ultrasonic welding.  In addition 
to performing this role, I also completely overhauled the database written in FileMaker, which included correcting some calculations that were previously 
incorrect and designing a new layout for the database interface.

### 05/12 - 08/12 Technical Intern at Corning incorporated, Corning, NY

This was my second internship with the Ultracapacitor group at Corning, and during my tenure I was tasked with replacing their current separator technology with 
something that was more robust, cheaper, and more amenable to roll-to-roll processes.  My results were promising, improving the performance of the button cells in addition
to satisfying all of the previously mentioned constraints.

### 05/11 - 08/11 Technical Intern at Corning incorporated, Corning, NY

My first internship with the Ultracapacitor group at Corning involved learning about the processes associated with the creation of the highly porous activated carbon
that makes up the electrodes in the ultracapacitor cell.  My task was to tweak the manufacturing process in order to reduce costs and reduce any wastes that were 
being produced.
