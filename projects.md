Links to my various projects:

### Electric Bike

I made an electric bike and use it as my daily commuter, images and detailed build log to come.


### Julia

A lot of my coding is now done in Julia, relevant posts will be listed here.

### Electrochemical Book Notes

I'm creating an organized reference that goes through chapters of Bard, summarizing the chapters in plain english and capturing important diagrams.

Once I find a way, it will also include interactive graphs made in python that can have graphs which update in real time and can offer an unprecedented intuition about how the parameters interact to cause the resulting output and are an exceptional learning tool.

See the [Bard Github](https://github.com/nealde/Notes-on-Bard) for ipython notebooks containing interactive plots and code for generating the plots.
