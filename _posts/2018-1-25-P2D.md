Spotholder for an eventual walkthrough of the P2D model that I'll be doing, hopefully with annotated latex like this:

$$v_{rxn} = v_{mt}=\frac{i}{nFA}$$ 

# it's still not working

what if I put more markdown later in the sheet? $$ q = EC_d(1-e^{(-t/(R_sC_d))}) $$

And then put another question later?
