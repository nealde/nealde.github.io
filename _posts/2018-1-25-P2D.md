Coming Soon!

However, as an introductory statement, if the [Single Particle Model]({{ site.baseurl}}\docs\spm) can be thought of as two single particles, illustrated below:

![spm]({{ site.baseurl}}/img/spm/spm.png)

Then the Pseudo Two-Dimensional model can be thought of as a bunch of these particles, at different depths in the electrode, surrounded by electrolyte.  

![p2d]({{ site.baseurl}}/img/p2d/p2d.png)

<!-- Spotholder for an eventual walkthrough of the P2D model that I'll be doing, hopefully with annotated latex like this:

$$v_{rxn} = v_{mt}=\frac{i}{nFA}$$

# it's still not working

what if I put more markdown later in the sheet? $$ q = EC_d(1-e^{(-t/(R_sC_d))}) $$

And then put another question later?
