My research is primarily focused on using Data Science techniques, including Machine Learning, to help improve the stability, 
flexibility, and reliability of physics-based Li-ion Battery models.  The work I've done so far focuses mostly on the 
[Pseudo-Two Dimensional Model](link) and how machine-learning generated surrogate models can be used to increase the predictive
accuracy and ease of application, which is a stepping stone to using them for control.  

As more work gets published, it will be added.
