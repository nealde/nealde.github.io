title: Extending Phone Battery Calendar Life with IFTTT
permalink: /docs/phonebatt/

placeholder for the post about usign Tasker, IFTTT, and a smart outlet to stop phone charging at an arbitraty limit - ~85% will double your battery life!
extra bonus: turning the outlet on a couple hours before getting up so that the phone doesn't spend all night fully charged.

Thought experiment about how this could be done at a charger hardware level, may be implemented later.
