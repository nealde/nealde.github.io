Spotholder for an eventual walkthrough of the P2D model that I'll be doing, hopefully with annotated latex like this:

$$y = x^2 \hbox{ when $x > 2$}$$

\(  A_1, A_2,\underbrace{A_3,\overbrace{A_4}^{\llap{oooo}\rlap{ver}} A_5}_{\text{under}}, A_6, A_7\)

$$A_1, A_2,\underbrace{A_3,\overbrace{A_4}^{\llap{oooo}\rlap{ver}} A_5}_{\text{under}}, A_6, A_7$$

$$\frac{x}{y}$$
