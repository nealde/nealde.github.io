However, as an introductory statement, if the [Single Particle Model]({{ site.baseurl}}\docs\spm) can be thought of as two single particles, illustrated below:

![spm]({{ site.baseurl}}/img/spm/spm_3d.png)

Then the Pseudo Two-Dimensional model can be thought of as a bunch of these particles, at different depths in the electrode, surrounded by electrolyte.

<!-- Spotholder for an eventual walkthrough of the P2D model that I'll be doing, hopefully with annotated latex like this: $$y = x^2 \hbox{ when $x > 2$}$$

$$v_{rxn} = v_{mt}=\frac{i}{nFA}$$

# it's still not working

what if I put more markdown later in the sheet?

$$q = EC_d(1-e^{(-t/(R_sC_d))})$$

And then put another question later? -->
