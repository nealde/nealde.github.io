Spotholder for an eventual walkthrough of the P2D model that I'll be doing, hopefully with annotated latex like this:

$
\frac{x^n}{x^m}\cdot  \frac{1+{\overbrace{\textstyle \frac{1}{x^n}}^{\color{red}{\geq -\frac{1}{2} \text{ for }|x| \text{ large enough}}}}}
                         {1+{\underbrace{\textstyle \frac{1}{x^m}}_{{\leq 1 \text{ for }|x| \text{ large enough}}}}}
$
