Spotholder for an eventual walkthrough of the P2D model that I'll be doing, hopefully with annotated latex like this:

$$y = x^2 \hbox{ when $x > 2$}$$


# it's still not working

what if I put more markdown later in the sheet?

$$ q = EC_d(1-e^{(-t/(R_sC_d))}) $$

And then put another question later?
