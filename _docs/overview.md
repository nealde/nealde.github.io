My research focuses on combining Data Science and numerically-solved, physics-based models, including the [Single Particle Model]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/spm) and the [Pseudo Two-Dimensional Model](coming soon!).

My first [paper](http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/165/2/A1.abstract?ct) has been published, which describes how domain knowledge can aid in data science problems.

Recently, my focus has shifted towards software engineering, including the development of [Battery.py](http://www.github.com/nealde/battery), a Python package for numerically solving battery models, which is still in development.

I've also had the privilege of working on several academic side projects, including:
 - [DeepQL](http://www.github.com/nealde/deepql) - A language for querying a deep neural network
 - [WYNS](http://www.github.com/nealde/wyns) - A tool for assessing twitter sentiment and displaying it in an interactive map, hosted on GCP.
 - [Deepchess](http://www.github.com/nealde/deepchess) - A reimplementation of DeepChess, a sorting-based deep neural network chess engine.
