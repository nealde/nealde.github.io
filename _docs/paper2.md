*By: Neal Dawson-Elli, Suryanarayana Kolluri, Kishalay Mitra, and Venkat R. Subramanian*

This work focuses on the idea that there is more information contained in the error between two time series than there is in a single-value abstraction of that data, and leverages neural networks to take advantage of this additional information to make per-parameter adjustments during optimization.
